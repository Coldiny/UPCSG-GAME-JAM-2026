# Game Title: EMBER

The Player has the ability to consume radiance emitted by Sentient Automatons(mobs/enemies) once killed and use their parts to become apart of them.

After numerous attempts to mass-produce Ember Stones, many automatons originally created to ease human labor such as farming became sentient and lifelike due to radiation emitted by the stones.
This led to the realization that Ember Stones were not merely a fuel source meant to save humanity, but something far greater. Soon after, the Everflame Project (we can change this i think)  was initiated, in which artificial humans were created by fusing them with Ember Stones. Some of these creations gained sentience, while others did not and remained in hibernation.
From that point onward, their focus shifted toward creating more Everflames, gradually losing sight of the project’s original purpose: to help humanity survive the Everlasting Frost that loomed ahead.
Not long after, humanity declined to the point of becoming an endangered species.
